Steps to run the code:
- Open terminal in the current folder and run "./script_c.sh <file_name>"
- If the code has error, syntax and semantic errors will be printed in the terminal.
- Else the Intermediate Code and MIPS Assembly Code is generated and stored(in the same folder where the input file is located) and the MIPS Code is simulated on SPIM simulator.
- The output is displayed on the terminal.

Eg: 
From the current folder, write:

./script_c.sh InputFiles/while_loop.c
In the folder InputFiles, the intermediate code and the MIPS Assembly code will be generated for this particular file and the output is displayed on the terminal
